# Ensure a project worktree follows the agent-memory file convention.
# AGENTS.md is the real project-intrinsic knowledge file. CLAUDE.md is a real
# regular file whose canonical content is the two-line @AGENTS.md pointer that
# Claude Code inlines at load time, except when an existing CLAUDE.md symlink
# is already present: that symlink is left in place.
# Creates a minimal AGENTS.md skeleton when neither file exists, promotes a
# real CLAUDE.md file when it is the only file present (unless it is already
# the canonical pointer), and refuses to clobber distinct real files or wrong
# symlinks.
# Owns the canonical "## Maintaining this file" self-governance wording.
# That section is included in a skeleton this helper creates.
# It is not appended to an existing AGENTS.md, or to a real CLAUDE.md file
# promoted into AGENTS.md, when that file does not already carry the section.
# A first-line project-owned mark is left untouched when present (exact first
# line, LF or CRLF):
# <!-- firstmate:maintained-by-project -->
# Existing files keep their current text. The mark stays in place and does not
# select a different edit. No prose equivalence is inferred.
# Owns the canonical CLAUDE.md pointer content (the exact two-line @AGENTS.md
# form). The helper writes that pointer when CLAUDE.md is absent, and after
# promoting a real CLAUDE.md file. It never replaces an existing symlink.
# Refuses a case-variant real memory file such as a lowercase agents.md, so a
# pointer's @AGENTS.md import resolves to a real AGENTS.md on a case-sensitive
# filesystem (issue #389).
# This is a worktree utility for crewmates, not a supervision script, so it does
# not call fm-guard.sh.

An existing AGENTS.md keeps its current text, including any maintenance guidance.
The canonical "## Maintaining this file" section is added only inside a skeleton
created when no memory file exists yet.
An existing CLAUDE.md symlink is left in place.
A missing CLAUDE.md is filled with the real @AGENTS.md pointer, and a real
CLAUDE.md that is the only memory file is promoted to AGENTS.md before that
pointer is written.
A first-line mark is left untouched when present (LF or CRLF):
